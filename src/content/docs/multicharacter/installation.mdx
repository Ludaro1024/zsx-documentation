# How to Properly Install the Multicharacter Resource

To ensure the resource is correctly installed and functioning, follow these steps:

import { Code, Steps, Tabs, TabItem} from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="ESX">
    <Steps>
      1. **Configure ESX**  
         If you're using ESX, make sure the following setting is enabled in the `es_extended/config.lua` or `es_extended/shared/main.lua` file:  
         <Code code='
         Config.Multichar = true (GetResourceState("esx_multicharacter") ~= "missing")
         'lang="lua" label="es_extended/config.lua" del='GetResourceState("esx_multicharacter") ~= "missing"'> 
         </Code>

         Delete the red part and replace it with true

      2. **Download the Resource**  
         Download the Multicharacter resource from the [Keymaster site](https://keymaster.fivem.net/).

      3. **Add the Resource to Your Server**  
         Drag the downloaded resource into your main `/resources` directory.

      4. **Update Your Configuration File**  
         Open your `server.cfg` (or use txAdmin > CFG Editor) and do the following:  
         Add the following lines to stop any existing multicharacter resources if you did not remove them already:  
           ```plaintext
           stop esx_multicharacter  # Default ESX multicharacter
           ```
         Add the following line to ensure the new Multicharacter resource starts:  
           ```plaintext
           ensure ZSX_Multicharacter
           ```
           this should be placed somewhere after your framework's `ensure` line.

      5. **Set the Number of Characters**  
         Configure the maximum number of characters in the `/shared/config.lua` file:  
         ```lua
         Config.Characters.Free = 1  -- Replace "1" with your desired number of free characters
         ```

      6. **Start Your Server**  
         Launch your server and enjoy the resource!
