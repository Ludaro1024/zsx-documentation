## How to Properly Install the UI Resource
To ensure the resource is correctly installed and functioning, follow these steps:

import { Aside, Code, Steps, Tabs, TabItem, FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      **Download the Resource**  
      Download the UI resource from the [Keymaster site](https://keymaster.fivem.net/).
    </li>
    <li>
      **Add the Resource to Your Server**  
      Drag the downloaded resource into your main `/resources` directory.
    </li>
    <li>
      **Update Your Configuration File**  
      Open your `server.cfg` (or use txAdmin > CFG Editor) and do the following:  
      Add the following line to ensure the new UI resource starts:  
      <pre><code>ensure ZSX_UIV2</code></pre>
      This should be placed somewhere after your framework's `ensure` line, preferably at the bottom of the file.
    </li>
    <li>
      **Configure**  
      Open the `config` files and configure the UI to your liking.
    </li>
    <li>
      **Start Your Server**  
      Launch your server and enjoy the resource!
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>


## Important Notes for Installation

### Welcome Screen

If you're using a loading screen with manual shutdown and want to manually close it, follow these steps:

Open this file

<FileTree>
- ZSX_UIV2
  - shared
    - config_loadingscreen.lua
</FileTree>

and change the following line:

```lua
Config.AwaitShutdownLoadingScreen = true
```
This will allow you to manually close the loading screen.

### Chat

To use our chat system, you need to start ZSX_UIV2 before your framework to ensure proper functionality.

You can start the ZSX_UIV2 resource right before your framework. By default, for QBCore, follow these steps:
<Tabs> 
<TabItem label ="QB-Core/Qbox"> 

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Open your <code>server.cfg</code> file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the following line <strong>before</strong> the <code>ensure qb-core</code> or <code>ensure [qb]</code> line:
      <pre><code>ensure ZSX_UIV2</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>


This ensures that ZSX_UIV2 loads first.

<Aside type="caution"> 
If you have set the ZSX_UIV2 directory to be inside /resources/[qb] , it will not work! Make sure ZSX_UIV2 is placed outside of that directory for proper functionality.
</Aside>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label ="ESX"> 

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Open your <code>server.cfg</code> file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the following line <strong>before</strong> the <code>ensure es_extended</code> or <code>ensure [core]</code> line:
      <pre><code>ensure ZSX_UIV2</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>


This ensures that ZSX_UIV2 loads first.

<Aside type="caution">
If you have set the ZSX_UIV2 directory to be inside /resources/[core], it will not work! Make sure ZSX_UIV2 is placed outside of that directory for proper functionality.
</Aside>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### ZSX_Multicharacter

If you're using the ZSX_Multicharacter resource, you need to change the following line in the

<FileTree>
- ZSX_UIV2
  - shared
    - config.lua
</FileTree>

file:

<Code code="ZSX_Multicharacter = 'MY_CHANGED_MULTICHARACTER'" lang="lua" ins="MY_CHANGED_MULTICHARACTER">

</Code>

Replace `MY_CHANGED_MULTICHARACTER` with the name of your resource. and then after that you need to change the following line aswell



<Code code="Config.CustomInitialization = true" lang="lua" ins="true">

</Code>

This will ensure that the ZSX_Multicharacter resource is loaded correctly. After that just restart the server and you should be good to go.


if you use any other multicharacter resource, you need to change the following line in the 
<FileTree>
- ZSX_UIV2
  - shared
    - config.lua
</FileTree>

<Code code="Config.CustomInitialization = true" lang="lua" ins="true">
</Code>

This will disable the Auto Initialization (Welcome Screen) and you need to manually initialize the UI with the following Event


# Auto Installer


The UI resource features an auto-installer that integrates the UI into both ox_lib and Frameworks. This feature is currently under development. To use it, simply run the following commands:

    /install_ox_lib_compatibility
    /install_qb_core_compatibility

These commands will install the UI into the respective scripts, ensuring compatibility with their functions.

<Aside type="caution">
The auto-installer is still in development and may not work as expected.
