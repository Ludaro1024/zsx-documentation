## How to Properly Install the UI Resource
To ensure the resource is correctly installed and functioning, follow these steps:

import { Aside, Code, Steps, Tabs, TabItem, FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Steps>

1. **Download the Resource**  
   Download the UI resource from the [Keymaster site](https://keymaster.fivem.net/).

2. **Add the Resource to Your Server**
    Drag the downloaded resource into your main `/resources` directory.

3. **Update Your Configuration File**
    Open your `server.cfg` (or use txAdmin > CFG Editor) and do the following:  
  
    Add the following line to ensure the new UI resource starts:  
    ```plaintext
    ensure ZSX_UI
    ```
    this should be placed somewhere after your framework's `ensure` line. best at the bottom of the file.

4. **Configure**

    Open the `config` files and configure the UI to your liking.

5. **Start Your Server**
    Launch your server and enjoy the resource!

</Steps>

## Important Notes for Configuration

### Welcome Screen

If you're using a loading screen with manual shutdown and want to manually close it, follow these steps:

Open this file

<FileTree>
- ZSX_UIV2
 - shared
  - config_loadingscreen.lua
</FileTree>

and change the following line:

```lua
Config.AwaitShutdownLoadingScreen = true
```
This will allow you to manually close the loading screen.

### Chat

To use our chat system, you need to start ZSX_UIV2 before your framework to ensure proper functionality.

You can start the ZSX_UIV2 resource right before your framework. By default, for QBCore, follow these steps:
<Tabs> 
<TabItem label ="QB-Core/Qbox"> 

<Steps>
1. Open your `server.cfg` file.
2. Add the following line **before** the `ensure qb-core` or `ensure [qb]` line:
```plaintext
ensure ZSX_UIV2
```

</Steps>

This ensures that ZSX_UIV2 loads first.

<Aside type="caution"> 
If you have set the ZSX_UIV2 directory to be inside /resources/[qb] , it will not work! Make sure ZSX_UIV2 is placed outside of that directory for proper functionality.
</Aside>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label ="ESX"> 

<Steps>
1. Open your `server.cfg` file.
2. Add the following line **before** the `ensure es_extended` or `ensure [core]` line:
```plaintext
ensure ZSX_UIV2
```

</Steps>

This ensures that ZSX_UIV2 loads first.

<Aside type="caution">
If you have set the ZSX_UIV2 directory to be inside /resources/[core], it will not work! Make sure ZSX_UIV2 is placed outside of that directory for proper functionality.
</Aside>


### ZSX_Multicharacter

If you're using the ZSX_Multicharacter resource, you need to change the following line in the

<FileTree>
- ZSX_UIV2
 - shared
  - config.lua
</FileTree>

file:

```lua
ZSX_Multicharacter = 'MY_CHANGED_MULTICHARACTER'
```

Replace `MY_CHANGED_MULTICHARACTER` with the name of your resource. and then after that you need to change the following line aswell

```lua
Config.CustomInitialization = true
```

This will ensure that the ZSX_Multicharacter resource is loaded correctly. After that just restart the server and you should be good to go.

<Aside type="note">
If you're using the ZSX_Multicharacter resource, you need to ensure that the ZSX_UIV2 resource is started before the ZSX_Multicharacter resource.
