## What is ZSX-UI V2?

ZSX-UI V2 is more than just a UI; it's a powerful, customizable kit designed for FiveM servers. It eliminates the need for additional resources, offering a seamless experience with an integrated design system for your server. Perfect for creating a consistent user interface across your server, it enables you to craft a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.

### What’s New in ZSX-UI V2?

The new version of ZSX-UI V2 is packed with fresh ideas and next-generation features, optimizing your server’s UI to deliver a better user experience. Here’s a look at what’s new:

- **Optimized for Future Integrations**: The entire interface is prepared to work with upcoming assets, ensuring long-term compatibility.
- **Cinematic Enhancements**: Subtle cinematic touches inspired by our Multicharacter system, adding depth to the gameplay without overshadowing core mechanics.
  
### Design Overhaul

We redesigned key components of the UI to create a cleaner, more cohesive design. Here’s a quick overview of the changes:

- **Configuration Screen**: A revamped design to better suit the UI system.

### Minimalism

We believe in simplicity, which is why ZSX-UI V2 follows a minimalistic approach. Unused components are removed dynamically, reducing on-screen clutter and letting players focus on gameplay. However, customization is at the core, and each player can adjust the UI to their liking (if allowed by the server).

### Job-Focused Components

ZSX-UI V2 introduces features designed to elevate roleplay experiences. These components include:

#### 3D Points

Points act as 3D waypoints, guiding players toward objectives. These points remain visible even when off-screen, improving navigation and keeping gameplay flowing smoothly.

#### Help Notifications

We’ve upgraded the notification system to support staged notifications, helping players track their progress through tasks. This ensures smoother gameplay and better task management.
