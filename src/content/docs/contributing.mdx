Welcome to the ZSX Development Documentation! We're excited to have you here and appreciate your interest in contributing to our resources. Whether you're a developer, designer, or content creator, there are many ways you can help us improve our documentation and enhance the experience for others.

On every page of the ZSX Development Documentation, you'll find a link to edit the source code on GitHub. This allows you to make changes directly to the documentation and submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged into the main repository.

Here we will guide you through the process of contributing to the ZSX Development Documentation and provide some tips on how you can make a positive impact on our resources.

You do this by editing md or mdx files in the `src/docs` folder. these represent the different sections of the documentation.

To Contribute you need a GitHub account and a basic understanding of Markdown and or MDX.

We use [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) for this Documentation and [Astro](https://astro.build/) as our static site generator. and you are welcome to use their features.
